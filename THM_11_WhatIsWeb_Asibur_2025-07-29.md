## 🧠 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
This report documents the completion of **TryHackMe’s "What is the Web"** room, which focuses on:

- Understanding HTTP, HTTPS & DNS  
- Learning how browsers & web servers communicate  
- Exploring the client–server model of the World Wide Web

> **Purpose:** Build a foundational knowledge of how web communication works to support later web penetration testing.

---

## 📜 **SCOPE & LIMITATIONS**
- Conceptual and quiz-based room; no exploitation performed
- No real target machine or IP address deployed
- Focus only on theoretical understanding of the web

---

## 💡 **BUSINESS IMPACT**
- Helps identify web attack surfaces by understanding HTTP flow
- Supports secure web design and testing
- Builds knowledge needed for later bug bounty or real-world pentests

---

## 📊 **FINDINGS TABLE**
| ID  | Finding                                | Risk | Evidence           | Recommendation      |
|----|----------------------------------------|-----|------------------|--------------------|
| N/A | This is a theory-based room; no vulnerabilities | N/A  | Key concept notes | No action required |

> ✅ No target machine or scanning – purely educational.

---

## 🔒 **ANALYSIS & RISK RATINGS**
| Scenario                             | Potential Impact |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Misconfigured HTTPS                | 🟥 High         |
| DNS spoofing risk                  | 🟧 Medium       |
| Lack of encryption (HTTP only)     | 🟨 Low          |

🟩 In this room: concept only – overall risk **Low**.

## 🛠️ **TOOLS & TECHNIQUES**
| Concept           | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| HTTP             | Transmit requests & responses                |
| HTTPS            | Secure data transfer using TLS/SSL           |
| DNS              | Resolves domain names to IP addresses        |
| Web Browser      | Client sending HTTP requests                  |
| Web Server       | Handles incoming requests, sends responses    |

---

## 🖼️ **KEY CONCEPTS**
> 🌐 **Client–Server Model**  
> User → Browser → HTTP request → Server → HTTP response → Browser displays page

> 🔒 **HTTPS:** Adds TLS/SSL encryption to protect data in transit

> 🧩 **DNS:** Converts domain (e.g., `example.com`) into numeric IP

> ⚠️ *Note:* No IP address or target machine in this room → proof section is concept-only.
