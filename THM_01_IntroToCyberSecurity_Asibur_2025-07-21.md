## ✨ Executive TL;DR
This document summarizes a completion-style assessment of [TryHackMe – Room #01: Introduction to Cyber Security](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtocyber).  
The room is educational and informational; no technical vulnerabilities were discovered because the lab focuses on theory, terminology, and multiple-choice tasks.

**Objective:** Learn foundational cybersecurity concepts and complete the in-room quiz.  

**Outcome:** Room completed with full marks; learner verified comprehension of CIA triad, threat types, hacker motivations, and basic defensive roles.  

**Business Value:** Ideal for onboarding non-technical staff and establishing baseline security awareness.

| Finding | Risk | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| [No application/system vulnerabilities (Informational)](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtocyber) | 🟢 Informational | Confirmed |

## 📜 Scope & Engagement

**In-Scope:**
- TryHackMe room content, interactive lessons, and quiz tasks for "Introduction to Cyber Security".

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Active exploitation, network scanning of external infrastructure, or interaction with systems outside the THM learning environment.

**Engagement Rules:**
- Only consume and document content presented inside the room.
- Preserve learner privacy and do not publish any account credentials or personal identifying information.
